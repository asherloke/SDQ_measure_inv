MCS.csv file is the main longitudinal data file obtained from UK data service

Data analyses were conduct in R

Before re-running data, do ensure the following packages are installed: tidyverse, broom, lavaan, lsr, semPlot, semTools

The Data analyses.rmd file contains code to load the packages so pre-loading is not needed

The code contains some t-test analyses and graphs that were not incldued or reported in the final report
